WHAT IS BODY POSITIVITY?

Body positivity is the acceptance of one’s self. It is the journey you take to love every part of your body despite society’s unattainable standards. It is the ability to feel confident about any changes your body may undergoes over time due to factors including age, nature, or your own personal changes. However, it is extremely hard for women to have a positive body image due to media’s unrealistic ideas about how a woman should be proportioned. As a result, women often feel insecure and unsatisfied with their bodies and do not acknowledge the history and value behind their features. Our goal is to create an environment for women where we can feel comfortable in our own skin and reject the century old idea that our bodies define us. Our goal is to encourage well-being over appearance and to remove the pressure to look a certain way by showing how important our bodies and facial features are to our health, culture and unique beauty.
